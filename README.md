## Description

In this project i refactored existing code to make it more clear, semantic and to make the page more accessible. I've reduced the CCS code end added comments. I also have replaced some HTML tags by semantic tags end added "alt" to the images. 
I've learn more about the code structure and semantic. I have learn what is the accessibility of a page, how important it is end how to make my pages more accessible.
